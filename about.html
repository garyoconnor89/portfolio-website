        <p>My name is Gary and I'm brand new to coding and web development. 
            I spent a good few years after graduating from University in pretty 
            menial jobs, saving up for a few big trips travelling, volunteering 
            and working abroad. I got back to the UK in 2017 and became an adult, 
            I now have a ring on my finger, two kids at my feet and a mortgage on 
            my back. For the last 4 years I've been working for a Complex Needs 
            Housing charity and as a Family Support Worker for a Special Needs 
            School. Both have been amazing and invaluable to my personal 
            development but after continuously banging my head against the brick 
            wall of a system which really didn't care, I decided I'd make a drastic 
            career change rather than risk my sanity. That leads me here! </p>
        <h4>Past Experience</h4>
